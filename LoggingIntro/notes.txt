Logs are associated with categories and that will allow us to configure the things differently
Course[0] ->ILogger CreateLogger()
{
    return loggerFactory.CreateLogger("Course");
}

Program[0] - 
ILogger<Program> logger = CreateLogger();


LogLevels  Size and the Severity
logger.LogInformation("Hello");


LogLevel.Trace ==> has the highest level of the information and the microsfot switches this off by default
This should never be used in an prod env
