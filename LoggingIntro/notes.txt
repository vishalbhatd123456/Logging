Logs are associated with categories and that will allow us to configure the things differently
Course[0] ->ILogger CreateLogger()
{
    return loggerFactory.CreateLogger("Course");
}

Program[0] - 
ILogger<Program> logger = CreateLogger();


LogLevels  Size and the Severity
logger.LogInformation("Hello");


LogLevel.Trace ==> has the highest level of the information and the microsfot switches this off by default
This should never be used in an prod env


ILogger is present at every place, in every application as such


When we send the prop objects to the logging, we will send the ability to capture the json objects directly

General convention ==>

ILogger<Program> logger = loggerFactory.CreateLogger<Program>();
